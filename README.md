# android_prebuilts_chromium

In order to use prebuilt chromium, you need patches for android build and framework webview (see http://github.com/ChronoMonochrome/android_device_samsung_codina/tree/7d04506294185fcfda755f148c3d86e30077c100/patches).

Please note that file libwebviewchromium.so in this repo is empty, replace it with file from your ROM.
